<p>Shows how individual ringers performed in this touch.</p>

<p>Mean error shows when a ringer is consistently late or early. This is quite possibly
something that can be corrected simply by pointing it out to the ringer concerned. However
mean errors may also be due to different sound paths to the ringer compared to the microphone
so careful listening is needed to ensure the "errors" are really present.</p>

<p>STD errors represent the amount of random errors relative to the smooth ringing model.
Poor figures here typically indicate poor rhythm, due to over-use of ropesight or poor bell
control and may indicate where to focus teaching of an inexperienced ringer but may not be
easily corrected in a someone experienced.</p>

<p>RMS error is a combination of mean and STD error and indicates the overall contribution of
each bell to the unevenness of the ringing. This data may be useful for band placement if
collected over many touches.</p>
